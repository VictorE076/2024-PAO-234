You will need to set a Java Development Kit (JDK), in order to develop Java applications.

- download the open-source build of Java 21 from: https://jdk.java.net/21/
- in `C:\Program Files`, create a new folder called `Java`
- extract the content of the build in this folder
- in System Variables, create a new variable called `JAVA_HOME`, pointing to the path of the build (i.e. `C:\Program Files\Java\open-jdk-21.0.2`)
- in System Variables, add to the `Path` variable the location of the bin folder (i.e.  `C:\Program Files\Java\open-jdk-21.0.2\bin`)

To test that everythink works as expected, run in terminal `java -version`

### 2. Maven

This will be useful in the future, when you will want to use projects already developed, from a central repository

- download the latest version of Maven from: https://maven.apache.org/, use the binary release
- in `C:\Program Files`, create a new folder called `Maven`
- extract the content of the archive in this folder
- in System Variables, create a new variable called `MAVEN_HOME`, pointing to the path of the build (i.e. `C:\Program Files\Maven\maven-apache-3.9.6`)
- in System Variables, add to the `Path` variable the location of the bin folder (i.e. `C:\Program Files\Maven\maven-apache-3.9.6\bin`)

To test that everythink works as expected, run in terminal `mvn -v`

### 3. Git
